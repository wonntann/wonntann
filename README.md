### Hi there. I'm Tanya ðŸ‘‹


I have been involved in the Arts and EduTech Community as a developer and have educated over 500 K-12 programming classes in various technologies such as Scratch, Python, JavaScript, C#, and Git. My passions lie with technology and the arts, I have been involved with a local Photography Museum as a Museum Educator and a Programming Educator for various web technologies and languages.
