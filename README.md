### Hi there. I'm Tanya ðŸ‘‹

With a rich background in both the Arts and EdTech Communities, I've dedicated myself to shaping the educational landscape as a curriculum developer and mentor. Over the course of my journey, I've had the privilege of instructing 500+ programming classes, delving into a diverse array of technologies such as Scratch, Python, JavaScript, and Git. Notably, my influence extends beyond the confines of traditional classroomsâ€”I've adeptly prepared over 100 clients for success through my Career Development class.

My passions lie with technology and the arts, I have actively contributed to my local Photography Museum as a Museum Educator. Simultaneously, my role as a Programming Educator has involved enlightening learners on various web technologies and programming languages.

My commitment extends beyond instruction; I aspire to cultivate an inclusive learning environment. As I craft lessons and share insights on diverse programming features, my primary goal is to empower learners. Creating a welcoming atmosphere is paramount in fostering growth, encouraging exploration of new technologies, and instilling best practices. I am dedicated to nurturing independent thought, ensuring that each learner not only acquires technical skills but also develops a mindset poised for success in the ever-evolving landscape of technology and the arts.
